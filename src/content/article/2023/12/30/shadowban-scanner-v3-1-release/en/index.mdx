Shadowban Scanner has been updated to v3.1. This version adds the ability to **"resurrect" tweets with external links** that have been hidden.

The main changes are as follows. All changes can be viewed on the [release page](https://github.com/Robot-Inventor/shadowban-scanner/releases/tag/v3.1.0) on GitHub.

## üéâNew Features

Recently, a problem with Twitter hiding tweets with external links has made headlines in Japan; it is [called a "tombstone" inside Twitter](https://0115765.com/archives/50433), and it seems to be an intentional behavior.

Shadowban Scanner was quick to address this issue and added the ability to "restore" hidden tweets!

When a hidden tweet with an external link is detected, a button is added to show the tweet. Clicking this button will display the hidden tweets.

## ü©πFixed

- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the share button to not work properly in TweetDeck

## FAQ

### Can I view hidden tweets without clicking the button?

No, you can't.

For technical reasons, it is difficult to display hidden tweets without clicking the button. Instead, clicking the button will display the tweet in a new tab.

## What is Shadowban Scanner?

Shadowban Scanner is an extension that allows you to check Twitter's so-called shadowban and sensitive judgments on the fly without having to go to an external site.

All processing is done on the user's computer. There is no communication with external servers or access to Twitter's internal APIs to obtain your credentials without your permission, as is the case with some extensions. Your data and privacy are protected.

Shadowban Scanner is available in the latest versions of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox for PCs. For technical reasons, it is not available on smartphones (except Firefox for Android).

:::note[Note]
Shadowban Scanner, like other similar tools, can produce false positives and false negatives; I recommend using it in conjunction with other tools while continuously checking account and tweet status with Shadowban Scanner.
