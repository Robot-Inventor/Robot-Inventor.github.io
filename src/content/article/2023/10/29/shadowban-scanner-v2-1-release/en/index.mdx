Shadowban Scanner has been updated to v2.1. This version includes several bug fixes and small improvements.

The main changes are as follows. All changes can be viewed on the [release page](https://github.com/Robot-Inventor/shadowban-scanner/releases/tag/v2.1.0) on GitHub.

## üéâNew Features

- Added setting to hide the notes at the bottom of the messages
- Enhanced detection of media sensitive flags in profiles to detect flags that were missed in v2.0
- "Display check results only in your own tweets" has been split into "Display check results for other users' tweets" and "Display check results for other users' profiles" to allow more detailed customization
- Release notes are now displayed when updated
- Updated the design of the settings page
- Added links to Privacy Policy and Open Source Licenses on the settings page

## üîßChanges

- Twemoji introduced in v2.0 is now bundled with the extension itself. This is an internal change, so there is no change in appearance
- Privacy Policy has been further clarified. The updated Privacy Policy can be found at the link on the settings page

## ü©πFixed

- Fixed a bug that caused the text color of messages to turn gray on the notification page
- Fixed a bug that prevented messages from being displayed when clicking on a tweet due to a recent update to Twitter (X)
- Fixed a bug that caused messages to appear on other people's profiles even when "Display check results only in your own tweets" was turned on
- Fixed a bug that caused the font in messages to be in serif type in some environments
- Fixed a bug that prevented messages from being displayed on profiles with a blank bio

## üìùOther

I am happy to announce that Shadowban Scanner will be **available for Firefox for Android starting in December**.

Until now, Shadowban Scanner was not available on smartphones because their web browsers did not support extensions. However, that situation is no longer the case.

With the release of Firefox v121 for Android in late December, many PC extensions will be available for smartphones. And Shadowban Scanner is among them!

Shadowban Scanner is already ready to support Firefox for Android and tested to work without any problems, so please wait for the December Firefox update!

### Disclaimer

The developer of Shadowban Scanner is not involved in the development of Firefox, and the Firefox development team is not involved in the development of Shadowban Scanner. Inquiries about Shadowban Scanner should be directed to [„Çç„Åº„ÅÑ„Çì (roboin)](https://twitter.com/keita_roboin) for inquiries about Shadowban Scanner, and the Firefox developer for inquiries about Firefox.

The specific timing of when Shadowban Scanner will be available for Firefox for Android may change depending on the development status of Firefox.

Only Firefox for Android will be newly supported from December. Shadowban Scanner will continue to be compatible with PC web browsers that have been available up to now, but there are no plans to support other web browsers or Firefox for iOS.
