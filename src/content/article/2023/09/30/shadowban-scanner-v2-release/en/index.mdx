It has been almost three months since the last update, but I have released version 2 of Shadowban Scanner, an extension that allows you to check Twitter (X) shadowban and sensitive judgments without having to go to an external site.

The [official website](https://shadowban-scanner.roboin.io/en/) and PV are also now available. Please take a look at it as well.

## Schedule for v3

I am currently preparing for the development of Shadowban Scanner v3.

As a private developer, I cannot make any promises regarding the release of v3, but I hope to be able to release it sooner than v2.

Shadowban Scanner v3 will include a button to tweet the results and the ability to detect display restrictions for legal reasons.

Shadowban Scanner offers all features for free. Please [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/keita_roboin) and spread the word about Shadowban Scanner as it will encourage development!

Also, if you have any problems, please send me a DM on Twitter or [GitHub](https://github.com/Robot-Inventor/shadowban-scanner).
