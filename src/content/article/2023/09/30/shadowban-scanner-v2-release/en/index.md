It has been almost three months since the last update, but I have released version 2 of Shadowban Scanner, an extension that allows you to check Twitter (X) shadowban and sensitive judgments without having to go to an external site.

The [official website](https://robot-inventor.github.io/shadowban-scanner/) is also now available. Please take a look at it as well.

## What Is Shadowban Scanner?

Shadowban Scanner is an extension that allows you to check Twitter's so-called shadowban and sensitive judgments on the fly without having to go to an external site.

Shadowban Scanner can be downloaded from the following links:

<div id="extension-badge-container">

[![Chrome](./chrome.svg)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enlganfikppbjhabhkkilafmkhifadjd/)
[![Edge](./Edge.svg)](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/shadowban-scanner/kfeecmboomhggeeceipnbbdjmhjoccbl)
[![Firefox](./Firefox.svg)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/shadowban-scanner/)

</div>
<style>
#extension-badge-container p {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1rem;
  margin: 1rem 0;
}
#extension-badge-container img {
  width: auto;
  height: 5rem;
}
</style>

Just install it on your web browser and you will have access to the following features

- Per-account shadowban and sensitive flag detection
- Sensitive flag detection for profile media (icons and header images)
- Detection of sensitive flags per tweet
- Detect age restrictions on tweets

All processing is done on the user's computer. There is no communication with external servers or access to Twitter's internal APIs to obtain your credentials without your permission, as is the case with some extensions. Your data and privacy are protected.

Shadowban Scanner is available in the latest versions of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox for PCs. For technical reasons, it is not available on smartphones (except Firefox Nightly for Android).

More information on how it works can be found on the following page.

:::note info
Shadowban Scanner, like other similar tools, can produce false positives and false negatives; I recommend using it in conjunction with other tools while continuously checking account and tweet status with Shadowban Scanner.

Shadowban Scanner v3 will include a button to tweet the results and the ability to detect display restrictions for legal reasons.

Shadowban Scanner offers all features for free. Please [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/keita_roboin) and spread the word about Shadowban Scanner as it will encourage development!

Also, if you have any problems, please send me a DM on Twitter or [GitHub](https://github.com/Robot-Inventor/shadowban-scanner).
